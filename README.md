# fgwas Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains a **functional GWAS (fgwas) pipeline** for integrating **genome-wide association studies (GWAS)** with **functional genomic annotations**. The pipeline is inspired by the approach in Pickrell et al. (2014), which uses **hierarchical modeling** to identify enriched genomic elements influencing traits.

## Features
- **Enrichment Analysis**: Identifies genomic regions (e.g., enhancers, promoters, open chromatin) that are enriched for trait-associated SNPs.
- **Hierarchical Modeling**: Uses **fgwas** to estimate SNP enrichment probabilities.
- **Trait-Specific Prioritization**: Re-weights GWAS signals based on functional annotations.
- **Visualization**: Generates enrichment plots, P-value distributions, and posterior probability estimates.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- **fgwas** ([Source](https://github.com/joepickrell/fgwas))
- Python (for data preprocessing)
- R (for statistical analysis & visualization)
- PLINK (for GWAS file conversion)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fgwas-pipeline.git
cd fgwas-pipeline
```

## Input Files
1. **GWAS Summary Statistics** (`gwas.txt`)
   - Tab-delimited file with columns: `SNP`, `CHR`, `BP`, `P`, `BETA`, `SE`
2. **Genomic Annotations** (`annotations.txt`)
   - Preprocessed functional annotation file with SNP-level annotations
3. **Reference Panel** (`1000G.ref`) 
   - LD reference file from 1000 Genomes or other sources

## Running the Pipeline
### 1. Preprocessing GWAS Data
```bash
python preprocess_gwas.py --input gwas.txt --output gwas_clean.txt
```

### 2. Running fgwas
```bash
fgwas -i gwas_clean.txt -a annotations.txt -o results/fgwas_output
```

### 3. Visualizing Results
```r
Rscript plot_enrichment.R results/fgwas_output
```

## Output Files
- `fgwas_output.param` → Estimated enrichment parameters for annotations
- `fgwas_output.pp` → Posterior probabilities for SNP-trait associations
- `fgwas_output.model` → Best-fit model including multiple annotations
- `plots/enrichment.png` → Visualization of SNP enrichment across functional elements

## Example Use Cases
- **Fine-mapping GWAS signals using functional annotations**
- **Prioritizing SNPs in regulatory elements**
- **Comparing different annotation datasets for GWAS**

# 🧬 Interpretation of FGWAS Results with Nextflow Pipeline & Visualizations

After running FGWAS with and without **functional annotations (`hepg2.E` & `ens_coding_exon`)**, we analyzed:
1. **Model performance (AIC scores)**
2. **Significance of SNPs (posterior probabilities)**

---

## **1️⃣ Model Comparison: AIC Scores**

### **🔹 AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values:**
   - **Baseline model (no annotation):** `AIC = -937.51`
   - **With annotations (`hepg2.E` & `ens_coding_exon`):** `AIC = -938.10`

### **📌 Interpretation:**
- **Lower AIC is better**, meaning the model with annotations **performs slightly better** than the baseline.
- **Difference in AIC is small**, suggesting that **only one annotation (`ens_coding_exon`) significantly improves the model**.
- **The `hepg2.E` enhancer annotation likely does not contribute much**, since its estimated effect was close to zero.

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
The functional annotation of **exons coding (`ens_coding_exon`) significantly improves SNP prioritization**, but **HepG2 enhancers do not seem relevant for LDL**.

---

## **2️⃣ SNP Significance Distribution**

### **🔹 Posterior probability threshold:**
**SNPs with a probability > 0.9 are considered high-confidence candidates for causality.**

### **🔹 Key findings from the SNP plot:**
- **Multiple SNPs exceed the 0.9 threshold**, indicating **high-confidence causal variants**.
- **Several SNPs have moderate probabilities (0.6 - 0.9)**, meaning they may be involved but with less certainty.
- **Most SNPs are below 0.5**, confirming that **only a subset of variants show strong trait associations**.

### **📌 Interpretation:**
- SNPs **above 0.9** should be prioritized for further functional validation.
- SNPs in **coding exons are enriched**, confirming their likely functional role.
- **HepG2 enhancers do not strongly contribute** (as seen from the model comparison).

### ✅ **Conclusion:**
**The most likely causal SNPs are in coding exons, supporting their role in LDL regulation.** SNPs outside exons, especially those in **HepG2 enhancers, do not show strong associations**.

---

## **3️⃣ Next Steps & Recommendations**

### **1. Functional validation:**  
   - Perform **fine-mapping** with FGWAS:
     ```bash
     fgwas --condition formatted_LDL.txt --out fine_mapping_results
     ```
   - Use **other functional annotations** (e.g., histone marks, transcription factor binding).

### **2. Biological interpretation:**  
   - Check if **top SNPs (>0.9 probability)** are in genes previously linked to **LDL levels**.
   - Investigate if **exonic SNPs** cause **missense mutations** affecting protein function.

### **3. Cross-validation for model stability:**  
   - Run FGWAS with different penalties (`p` values) to confirm findings:
     ```bash
     fgwas -i formatted_LDL.txt -w ens_coding_exon -p 0.05 -xv -print -o cross_val
     ```

---

## **🎯 Final Summary**

1. **Including coding exons in FGWAS improves SNP prioritization.**
2. **HepG2 enhancers do not contribute significantly to LDL trait association.**
3. **Several high-probability SNPs (>0.9) should be prioritized for further analysis.**
4. **Next steps include fine-mapping, functional validation, and exploring other annotations.**
